# BloodbankApi

### My First Challenge at Grazac Academy

The benefit of having a spontaneous blood bank app in a mega city cannot be overemphasized. Bloodline aims to remove obstacles in checking, receiving and donating matching blood with little or no hassle. You have been tasked to create an open (unprotected route) that allows user to perform the following:
..User can see all bloods types (showing rhesus factor, Blood Group and other information you have asked when they create blood sample information)
..Users can update blood sample information sent initially to the database
..Users can delete his offer because of his/her health conditions.


#### The packages used for this challenge are: 
VSCode for my environment,
MONOGOD for my Database,
POSTMAN for my api testing,
Markdown for my documentation,
Github for my version control.
